Here, srclib-javascript enables\nclickable links for every identifier (that take you to their definitions),\nautomatic cross-repository usage examples, type inference, and documentation\ngeneration.\n\n![screenshot](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sourcegraph-assets/sourcegraph-javascript-screenshot-0.png \"Sourcegraph.com JavaScript screenshot\")\n\nThe second screenshot shows the\n[emacs-sourcegraph-mode plugin for Emacs](https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/emacs-sourcegraph-mode)\nwith this toolchain installed. Here, srclib-javascript enables\njump-to-definition, type inference, documentation generation, and automatic\ncross-repository usage examples from [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com).\nAll code analysis is performed locally by [srclib](https://srclib.org) using\nthis toolchain.\n\n![screenshot](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sourcegraph-assets/emacs-sourcegraph-mode-screenshot-0.png \"Emacs JavaScript screenshot\")\n\n## Known issues\n\nsrclib-javascript is alpha-quality software. It powers code analysis on\n[Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com) but has not been widely tested or\nadapted for other use cases. It also has several limitations.\n\n* Currently only detects and analyzes CommonJS packages (anything with a\n  package.json), including Node.js packages. In particular, this means it\n  **generally does not handle front-end/client-side JavaScript**.\n* Does not handle global ECMAScript 5 (`Array.prototype.` methods, etc.) or\n  browser objects (`window`, `document`, etc.) well.\n* Gets easily confused by complex CommonJS module re-exporting. (E.g., when an\n  index.js file requires submodules and re-exports them, it doesn't do a good\n  job of tracing external invocations of the module to their actual function\n  literal definition.)\n\n## Tests\n\nTesting this toolchain requires that you have installed `src` from\n[srclib](https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/srclib) and that you have this\ntoolchain set up. See srclib documentation for more information.\n\nTo test this toolchain's output against the expected output, run:\n\n```\n# build the Docker container to run the tests in isolation\nsrc toolchain build sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/srclib-javascript\n\n# run the tests\nsrc test\n```\n\nBy default, that command runs tests in an isolated Docker container. To run the\ntests on your local machine, run `src test -m program`. See the srclib\ndocumentation for more information about the differences between these two\nexecution methods.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPatches are welcomed via GitHub pull request! See\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\nsrclib-javascript's type inference is based on [Tern](http://ternjs.net/).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib-javascript.git"},"scripts":{"test":"which src || (echo You must install src to run tests.
