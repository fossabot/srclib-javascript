This feature was introduced recently, and may change\nor be removed in future versions.  Please try it out and provide feedback.\nIf it addresses a use-case that is important to you, tell the node core team.\n\n2 - Unstable.  The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had\nsufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility\nwill be maintained if reasonable.\n\n3 - Stable.  The API has proven satisfactory, but cleanup in the underlying\ncode may cause minor changes.  Backwards-compatibility is guaranteed.\n\n4 - API Frozen.  This API has been tested extensively in production and is\nunlikely to ever have to change.\n\n5 - Locked.  Unless serious bugs are found, this code will not ever\nchange.  Please do not suggest changes in this area, they will be refused.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","version":"0.0.0"},"Ops":{"depresolve":null,"graph":null}}
